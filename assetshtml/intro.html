        <h1 align=center>An Easy To Use Source-Code Editor</h1>
        <p align=Center>
                      I think Visual Studio Code is a fun and easy to use editor. VS Code has extensions that allow the user to 
              customize their experience. I first began working with Visual Studio Code in the fall of 2020. Since then I 
              only use VS code. I found that it is easy to navigate, fun to code on, and has the ability to share screens 
              and chat with others. I find that adding extensions really makes the editor your own. The application reads 
              my JSON file upon launch of the application and randomly changes the colors of my backgrounds and borders. 
              It aslo allows me to change my syntax colors and error messages. There are so many more extensions that allow
              me to make my editor my home. 
        </p>

                      What makes VS Code the best compiler/editor out there is that it possesses a great amount of capability and 
            compatibility. It is able to run python, ruby, C, C++, Java, Javascript, HTML, and so much more. I have also 
            found that there is a lot of places to find help when errors do occur. I can search the web and find
            an answer to my problem rather quickly. I also do a lot of my file management from my terminal and VS Code is 
            compatible with my terminal. Therefore, the process of deleting, finding, and moving files becomes easy. My next
            big reason for using VS Code is because it is easy to create repositories and run git commands in. I have become 
            rather fond of VS Code for its fun and interactive face.
